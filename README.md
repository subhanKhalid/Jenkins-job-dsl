# Job DSL Example Repo

This is an example project that is meant to be used hand-in-hand with [Getting Started With Jenkins Job DSL Plugin for Standardising Your Pipelines](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/02/23/getting-started-jobdsl-standardised/).

THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE ON LATEST JENKINS VERSIONS. 

Will try Jenkins shared pipeline library with Job DSL next.
